# üß¥ DermaScan ‚Äì AI-Powered Skin Cancer Detector & Explainer

DermaScan is a web-based AI application that allows users to upload a photo of a skin lesion and receive an instant risk classification ‚Äî **Benign** or **Suspicious** ‚Äî along with a simple, AI-generated explanation in natural language. It runs **entirely in-browser**, prioritizing **privacy**, **speed**, and **usability** with zero server-side image processing.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common yet treatable cancers if caught early. DermaScan empowers individuals with **accessible, AI-powered pre-screening** directly in their browser ‚Äî without needing to send personal images to any server. This tool combines image classification and large language model (LLM) explanation to make AI decisions understandable and trustworthy.

---

## üß† What It Does

1. **Image Upload**  
   Users drag and drop or upload a photo of a skin lesion.

2. **AI-Powered Risk Classification**  
   A TensorFlow.js model (or Hugging Face-hosted model) runs entirely in-browser to classify the lesion as either *Benign* or *Suspicious*.

3. **Plain English Explanation**  
   A small LLM (e.g., GPT-4 via API or a distilled open-source model) explains the classification in simple terms (e.g., _"irregular borders and uneven coloring are common signs of melanoma."_)

4. **Confidence Score & Disclaimers**  
   The model‚Äôs confidence level is displayed along with a clear disclaimer that it is not a substitute for professional diagnosis.

## üí° Why It Matters

- **Privacy-First**: All inference is done locally in the browser.
- **Explainable AI**: Users don‚Äôt just get a result ‚Äî they understand *why*.
- **Accessible**: No signup, no app download, and works on mobile.
- **Actionable Impact**: Early awareness = earlier checkups = lives saved.

## üß™ Model Details

- **Model Source**: [Anwarkh1/Skin_Cancer-Image_Classification](https://huggingface.co/Anwarkh1/Skin_Cancer-Image_Classification)
- **Categories**: `benign`, `malignant` (can be mapped to ‚Äúbenign‚Äù and ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù)
- **Inference**: Can be run using `transformers.js`, `ONNX.js`, or TensorFlow.js depending on compatibility
- **Alternative**: Train or fine-tune a MobileNetV2 or ResNet model using TensorFlow/Keras and convert to TF.js
