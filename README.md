## 🤖 Our State-of-the-Art AI Models

We didn’t just build one model—we developed **two rigorously optimized engines**, each tuned for distinct use cases:

---

## 🩺 1️⃣ The Clinical Model (EfficientNet-B3): Surgical Precision for Medical Professionals

### 🎯 Purpose

A high-precision tool designed to **augment dermatologist workflows** by analyzing dermatoscopic images with **expert-level reliability**.

### 🧠 Architecture

* **EfficientNet-B3**, selected after head-to-head experiments against EfficientNet-B2.
* Fine-tuned with:

  * **Focal Loss** to focus on difficult cases.
  * **Class weighting** to counter data imbalance.
  * **Two-phase training:** first the classifier head, then the full model.

### 🗂️ Dataset

* **ISIC 2018/2019 Dermatoscopy datasets** (benchmark-quality, diverse lesion types).
